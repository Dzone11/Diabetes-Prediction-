# Diabetes Prediction App

This is a web application for predicting diabetes based on user input using a machine learning model.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Flask application script.
- `train_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training the model.
- `diabetes_prediction_model.pkl`: Trained ML model (pickle file).
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
